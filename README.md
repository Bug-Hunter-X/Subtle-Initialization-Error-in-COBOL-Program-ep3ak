This repository contains a COBOL program demonstrating a common subtle error related to variable initialization. The program calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10. The bug lies in a missing or incorrect initialization step, causing unexpected results. The solution demonstrates the correct way to initialize variables to prevent this issue.  The error is subtle, highlighting the importance of careful variable handling in COBOL.
